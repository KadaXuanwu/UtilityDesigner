# UtilityAi



This git repository contains the LaTeX documentation associated with this thesis, as well as a Unity project (compatible with Unity version 2022) that includes the implementation developed for this thesis.

Inside the Assets directory, a folder named KadaXuanwu can be found, which contains the asset that has been submitted to the Unity Asset Store. This asset includes three Unity packages which can be imported to obtain two example scenes. One package contains scenes for the Built-In Render Pipeline, another for the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), and the last one for the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). Remember to also import Unity's "AI Navigation" package before running the sample scenes, as it is needed for pathfinding.

Outside of the KadaXuanwu directory, there is a Scenes folder that contains an additional example scene. This scene is identical to the Survival scene found in the Utility Designer examples, but with enhanced visual assets. It couldn't be bundled with the Utility Designer asset because the low-poly prefabs are sourced from a different asset.

I fully own this asset and it is also available on the Unity Asset Store. Feel free to use and change this code for your own project or to create pull requests. Please do not sell it without my permmission.
